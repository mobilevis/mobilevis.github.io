**Workshop Organizers (R-L)**: Bongshin Lee, Matthew Brehmer, Eun Kyoung Choe, Petra Isenberg, Ricardo Langer, and Raimund Dachselt.

Our organization team is comprised of members having several relevant qualifications that will ensure a successful workshop. The core background of our team members range from visualization research (Brehmer, Isenberg, Lee) to HCI (Choe, Dachselt, Langner, Lee) to UbiComp (Choe). All team members have previously organized industry and academic workshops in several venues, and have extensive experience reviewing publications for international conferences, workshops, and symposia. Furthermore, all workshop organizers are committed, responsible, and highly motivated to organize this workshop.

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Bongshin Lee](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/bongshin/) ([@bongshin](https://twitter.com/bongshin)) is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research. She explores innovative ways to enable people to create visualizations, interact with their data, and share data-driven stories. She has been recently focusing on helping people collect & explore the data about themselves, and share insights with others by leveraging visualizations. She earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Maryland at College Park in 2006. 

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Matthew Brehmer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mabrehme/) ([@mattbrehmer](https://twitter.com/mattbrehmer)) is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft Research and a representative of the Microsoft Data Journalism Program. His research interests involve designing and evaluating information visualization techniques for storytelling and journalism, considering the perspectives of both the audience or information consumer and the author or content creator. He is the co-organizer of the IEEE PacificVis Visual Data Storytelling Contest. 
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 2016.

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Eun Kyoung Choe](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~choe/) ([@slowalpaca](https://twitter.com/slowalpaca)) is an Assistant Professor in the College of Information Studies at University of Maryland, College Park. She has been examining ways to help people become empowered individuals through fully leveraging their personal data. She has been exploring this topic in various contexts including the Quantified Self movement, sleep, patient-clinician communication, and personal data insights & visualization. She received her Ph.D. in Information Science from University of Washington in 2014.

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Petra Isenberg](https://petra.isenberg.cc/wiki/pmwiki.php) ([@dr_pi](https://twitter.com/dr_pi))  is a research scientist at Inria. Prior to joining Inria, Petra received her PhD from the University of Calgary in 2009. Her main research areas are information visualization and visual analytics with a focus on collaborative work scenarios, interaction, and evaluation. She is interested in exploring how people can most effectively analyze data sets on novel display technology such as small touch-screens, wall displays, or tabletops. 

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Ricardo Langner](https://imld.de/our-group/team/ricardo-langner/) ([@riclangner](https://twitter.com/riclangner)) is a Ph.D. student at the Technische Universität Dresden. His research focuses on the combination of multiple displays, such as mobile devices, interactive tabletops, and large shared displays, for information visualization. In particular, he explores new and innovative ways of using mobile devices to support data exploration with multiple coordinated visualization views. He was also a local arrangements co-chair of the 2014 ACM International Conference on Interactive Tabletops and Surfaces.

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> [Raimund Dachselt](https://imld.de/our-group/team/raimund-dachselt/) ([@RaimundDachselt](https://twitter.com/RaimundDachselt)) is a full university professor for Computer Science at Technische Universität Dresden and heads the Interactive Media Lab Dresden. His research focus are Natural User Interface (NUI) approaches with various input modalities on interactive surfaces and in multi-display environments. His team contributed several solutions applying NUI techniques to the field of Information Visualization and shaping the field of Immersive Analytics.
