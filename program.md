## Workshop Schedule

The focus of the workshop will be an interactive dialog of about 25 attendees (including organizers) with multidisciplinary backgrounds. 

The following table shows a preliminary schedule on how our workshop will be organized. It is important for us to ensure that the workshop allows attendees to have a holistic experience of the overall research topic ranging from technical solutions used in specific projects to future visions.

After a [welcome and introduction by the organizers](https://aka.ms/mobilevis-intro), the morning session allows all participants to briefly introduce themselves by means of short paper and position statement presentations. We will begin with two sessions of 7-minute presentations (+2 minutes Q+A) from the authors of accepted papers. 

Each presentation should include the following: 
-	**Intro**: Short intro of the presenter (and co-authors, if present), background and research interest 
-	**Paper**: Presentation of the submission (not more than 5 minutes!) 
-	**Outro**: One slide with a couple of statements or research questions as a starting point for discussion or a vision for MobileVis. As inspiration, where do you think the field will develop to? What are the most challenging and interesting research questions? What is your personal interest in continuing work in this field? 

After a joint lunch at **[Universel restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/pkvAbz5JzJu)**, which allows participants to meet and network informally in groups of 5 or 6, the workshop will continue with hands-on experiences in a relaxed demo atmosphere. Short demonstrations of different forms of prototypes, including sketches, case studies, and implementations (solicited from workshop participants and industry), will foster a discussion of state-of-the-art design and implementation approaches.

In the demo session, we will ask participants to contribute in one or more of the three following ways: 
-	Bring a **Demo** (sketches, case studies, apps, hardware or software prototypes…) and show it during this session. 
-	**Hall of Fame**: Pick a favorite visualization (might be an app) on a mobile device, make snapshot(s) and put together some reasons why it is good. 
-	**Hall of Shame**: Pick a most disliked/worst mobile visualization/application, make snapshot(s) and put together some reasons why it is bad. 

For these Halls of Fame and Shame, we have prepared a **[slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZhDJUTvg6djt37i4aADAVyh9Wb8kFDkSCLvB8trjOtk/edit?usp=sharing)**. Please add a new slide for each positive or negative example. Also add your name in the slide note section to know who contributed the example. 

The afternoon session will continue with a creative envisioning & design session, during which small groups of 3--5 people will work on specific ideas for future mobile visualization concepts. To support creativity and originality, we will make use of paper prototyping and crafting materials. After the afternoon coffee break, each group will pitch their project (such as by acting out scenarios), and we will quickly discuss the potential of each concept following each pitch. In a final break-out and brainstorming session, participants will collect ideas, concepts, and issues on the future of data visualization on mobile devices. Written on cards or notes, we will try to group and discuss ideas for shaping a research agenda in this emerging field.

The official part of the workshop will conclude with a brief summary discussion. We plan to organize an optional joint dinner to further socialize and continue discussions and networking.
