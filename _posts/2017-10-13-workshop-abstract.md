Researchers across several HCI-related communities have investigated various aspects of data visualization on mobile devices. Yet, we are far from leveraging the full potential of mobile devices in satisfying the growing demand for visual access to data on small displays. As mobile visualization becomes more common and new mobile device form factors and hardware capabilities emerge in the coming years, it is timely to reflect on what has been discovered to date and to look into the future. This workshop will bring together researchers, designers, and practitioners from relevant application and research fields, including visualization, personal informatics, and data journalism. Our goal is to define a research agenda for mobile data visualization as well as to collect and propagate practical guidance for mobile visualization designers.
