The focus of the workshop will be an interactive dialog up to 25 attendees (including organizers) with multidisciplinary backgrounds. 

The following table shows a preliminary schedule on how our workshop will be organized. It is important for us to ensure that the workshop allows attendees to have a holistic experience of the overall research topic ranging from technical solutions used in specific projects to future visions.

| **Time** 	          | Activity            	                | Duration 	|

After an opening, the morning session allows all participants to briefly introduce themselves by means of short paper and position statement presentations. To avoid the semblance of a small conference, we encourage short presentations ~5 minutes for individual contributions. Depending on the number of submissions, we plan to have 2-4 thematically grouped presentation sessions in the morning. Each round will end with a short wrap-up discussion to seek a common ground for afternoon discussions. These morning session also allows time for invited talks by selected experts from research communities and industry.

After a joint lunch, which allows participants to meet and network informally, the workshop will continue with hands-on experiences in a relaxed demo atmosphere. Short demonstrations of different forms of prototypes, including sketches, case studies, and implementations (solicited from workshop participants and industry), will foster a discussion of state-of-the-art design and implementation approaches.

The afternoon session will continue with a creative envisioning & design session, during which small groups of 3--5 people will work on specific ideas for future mobile visualization concepts. To support creativity and originality, we will make use of paper prototyping and crafting materials. After the afternoon coffee break, each group will pitch their project (such as by acting out scenarios), and we will quickly discuss the potential of each concept following each pitch. In a final break-out and brainstorming session, participants will collect ideas, concepts, and issues on the future of data visualization on mobile devices. Written on cards or notes, we will try to group and discuss ideas for shaping a research agenda in this emerging field.

The official part of the workshop will conclude with a brief summary discussion. We plan to organize a joint dinner to further socialize and continue discussions and networking.
