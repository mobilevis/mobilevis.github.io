Researchers across several HCI-related communities have investigated various aspects of data visualization on mobile devices. Yet, we are far from leveraging the full potential of mobile devices in satisfying the growing demand for visual access to data. As mobile visualization becomes more common and as new mobile device form factors and hardware capabilities emerge in the coming years, it is timely to reflect on what has been discovered to date and to look to the future. This workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from relevant application and research fields, including personal health, emergency response, and journalism. It will help us set a research agenda for mobile data visualization and collect and propagate actionable guidance for mobile app designers.
