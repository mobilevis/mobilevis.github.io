<h1 class="workshop-title passed">Data Visualization on Mobile Devices Workshop @ CHI 2018</h1>

The <strong>Data Visualization on Mobile Devices workshop at CHI 2018</strong> is intended to be a platform to exchange information and experiences, to stimulate discussion, and to answer the following questions:

- _What are the mobile-inherent and application-specific challenges in designing interfaces for visualizing and exploring data on mobile devices?_
- _How can we address these challenges?_
- _What are new and exciting ways to use mobile devices for data visualization?_

This workshop will bring participants with diverse backgrounds together to identify the most pressing mobile visualization challenges that evolve out of practice and to establish opportunities for future collaboration. To see what we have planned, check out our **[Program](#program)**.

## Workshop Abstract

Researchers across several HCI-related communities have investigated various aspects of data visualization on mobile devices. Yet, we are far from leveraging the full potential of mobile devices in satisfying the growing demand for visual access to data on small displays. As mobile visualization becomes more common and new mobile device form factors and hardware capabilities emerge in the coming years, it is timely to reflect on what has been discovered to date and to look into the future. This workshop will bring together researchers, designers, and practitioners from relevant application and research fields, including visualization, personal informatics, and data journalism. Our goal is to define a research agenda for mobile data visualization as well as to collect and propagate practical guidance for mobile visualization designers.

## <a id='cfp'></a> Call for Participation

With an increasing use of mobile devices in everyday life, it is important to understand how to design data visualizations for small displays. A nuanced understanding is especially important since existing guidelines for visualization and data interaction design do not transfer well to mobile devices. This one-day workshop aims to bring together visualization researchers and practitioners from application domains, to share experiences, identify open problems, and explore the future of mobile visualization. We will share academic and application-related outputs, and conduct hands-on design and brainstorming activities.

We solicit **4-6 page workshop papers** excluding references (using the **[CHI Extended Abstracts format](https://chi2018.acm.org/chi-proceedings-format/)**) in the following contribution types:

- **Research papers** describing existing mobile data visualizations or early concepts;
- **Position papers** discussing existing & future designs and processes;
- **Demonstrations** of prototypes and completed projects.

Submissions should cover contributions on visualizing data on various mobile devices (e.g., tablets, smart phones/watches, wearable devices, and tiny screens) addressing the following topics:

### Important workshop topics:

- Visual encodings
- Personal data visualization
- Glanceable visualization
- Responsive visualization
- Data-driven storytelling
- Natural and multi-modal interaction
- Visualization tasks
- Visualization authoring
- Libraries and toolkits
- Evaluation methods
- Best practices and pitfalls in the design process

Please submit a paper to the **[EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018)** ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018)).

We will select submissions based on a number of criteria, including originality or controversy of the paper, the complementary nature of the authors' research background, and the quality of the authors' previous work related to the workshop topic.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and all workshop participants must register not only for the workshop but also for at least one day of the **[2018 ACM CHI conference](https://chi2018.acm.org/)**.

### Important Dates:

- **January, 2018**: The **[submission portal](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018)** will open.

<br>
After a [welcome and introduction by the organizers](https://aka.ms/mobilevis-intro), the morning session allows all participants to briefly introduce themselves by means of short paper and position statement presentations. We will begin with two sessions of 7-minute presentations (+2 minutes Q+A) from the authors of accepted papers.

Each presentation should include the following:

- **Intro**: Short intro of the presenter (and co-authors, if present), background and research interest
- **Paper**: Presentation of the submission (not more than 5 minutes!)
- **Outro**: One slide with a couple of statements or research questions as a starting point for discussion or a vision for MobileVis. As inspiration, where do you think the field will develop to? What are the most challenging and interesting research questions? What is your personal interest in continuing work in this field?

After a joint lunch at **[Universel restaurant](https://goo.gl/maps/pkvAbz5JzJu)**, which allows participants to meet and network informally in groups of 5 or 6, the workshop will continue with hands-on experiences in a relaxed demo atmosphere. Short demonstrations of different forms of prototypes, including sketches, case studies, and implementations (solicited from workshop participants and industry), will foster a discussion of state-of-the-art design and implementation approaches.

In the demo session, we will ask participants to contribute in one or more of the three following ways:

- Bring a **Demo** (sketches, case studies, apps, hardware or software prototypes…) and show it during this session.
- **Hall of Fame**: Pick a favorite visualization (might be an app) on a mobile device, make snapshot(s) and put together some reasons why it is good.
- **Hall of Shame**: Pick a most disliked/worst mobile visualization/application, make snapshot(s) and put together some reasons why it is bad.

For these Halls of Fame and Shame, we have prepared a **[slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ZhDJUTvg6djt37i4aADAVyh9Wb8kFDkSCLvB8trjOtk/edit?usp=sharing)**. Please add a new slide for each positive or negative example. Also add your name in the slide note section to know who contributed the example.

The afternoon session will continue with a creative envisioning & design session, during which small groups of 3--5 people will work on specific ideas for future mobile visualization concepts. To support creativity and originality, we will make use of paper prototyping and crafting materials. After the afternoon coffee break, each group will pitch their project (such as by acting out scenarios), and we will quickly discuss the potential of each concept following each pitch. In a final break-out and brainstorming session, participants will collect ideas, concepts, and issues on the future of data visualization on mobile devices. Written on cards or notes, we will try to group and discuss ideas for shaping a research agenda in this emerging field.

The official part of the workshop will conclude with a brief summary discussion. We plan to organize an optional joint dinner to further socialize and continue discussions and networking.
