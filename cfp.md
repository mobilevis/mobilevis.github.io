With an increasing use of mobile devices and wearable technologies in everyday life, it is important to understand how to design data visualizations for these small displays. A nuanced understanding is especially important since existing guidelines for visualization and data interaction design do not transfer well to mobile devices. This one-day workshop aims to bring together visualization researchers, designers, and members from application domains, to share experiences, identify open problems, and look into the future of mobile visualization development and design. This workshop will involve sharing of academic and application-related outputs as well as hand-on design exercises and brainstorming sessions.
