With an increasing use of mobile devices in everyday life, it is important to understand how to design data visualizations for small displays. A nuanced understanding is especially important since existing guidelines for visualization and data interaction design do not transfer well to mobile devices. This one-day workshop aims to bring together visualization researchers and practitioners from application domains, to share experiences, identify open problems, and explore the future of mobile visualization. We will share academic and application-related outputs, and conduct hands-on design and brainstorming activities. 

We solicit 4-6 page-long workshop papers excluding references (using the [CHI Extended Abstracts format](https://chi2018.acm.org/chi-proceedings-format/)) covering various contributions on visualizing data on various mobile devices, including tablets, smart phones/watches, wearable devices, and tiny screens:
- **Research papers** describing existing mobile data visualizations or early concepts;
- **Position papers** discussing existing & future designs and processes;
- **Demonstrations** of prototypes and completed projects.

Important workshop topics: 
- Visual encodings and visualization tasks
- Personal data visualization 
- Glanceable and responsive visualization
- Data-driven storytelling
- Natural and multi-modal interaction
- Visualization authoring
- Libraries and toolkits
- Evaluation methods
- Best practices and pitfalls in the design process

Please submit to [easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018).
We will select participants according to originality/controversy of the paper, complementary nature of research background, and the quality of the work related to the workshop topic.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and all workshop participants must register not only for the workshop but also for at least one day of the conference.
