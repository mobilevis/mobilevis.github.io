With an increasing use of mobile devices in everyday life, it is important to understand how to design data visualizations for small displays. A nuanced understanding is especially important since existing guidelines for visualization and data interaction design do not transfer well to mobile devices. This one-day workshop aims to bring together visualization researchers and practitioners from application domains, to share experiences, identify open problems, and explore the future of mobile visualization. We will share academic and application-related outputs, and conduct hands-on design and brainstorming activities. 

We solicit **4-6 page workshop papers** excluding references (using the **[CHI Extended Abstracts format](https://chi2018.acm.org/chi-proceedings-format/)**) in the following contribution types:
- **Research papers** describing existing mobile data visualizations or early concepts;
- **Position papers** discussing existing & future designs and processes;
- **Demonstrations** of prototypes and completed projects.

Submissions should cover contributions on visualizing data on various mobile devices (e.g., tablets, smart phones/watches, wearable devices, and tiny screens) addressing the following topics: 
### Important workshop topics:
- Visual encodings
- Personal data visualization 
- Glanceable visualization
- Responsive visualization
- Data-driven storytelling
- Natural and multi-modal interaction
- Visualization tasks
- Visualization authoring
- Libraries and toolkits
- Evaluation methods
- Best practices and pitfalls in the design process

Please submit a paper to the **[EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018)** ([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018))}.

We will select submissions based on a number of criteria, including originality or controversy of the paper, the complementary nature of the authors' research background, and the quality of the authors' previous work related to the workshop topic.

At least one author of each accepted paper must attend the workshop and all workshop participants must register not only for the workshop but also for at least one day of the **[2018 ACM CHI conference](https://chi2018.acm.org/)**. 

### Important Dates:
- **January, 2018**: The **[submission portal](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=mobilevis2018)** will open. 
- **Friday, February 2, 2018**: Workshop paper deadline
- **Thursday, February 22, 2018**: Notification of acceptance
- **TBA**: Conference early registration deadline 
- **Saturday, April 21, 2018**: The workshop will take place as part of the **[2018 ACM CHI conference](https://chi2018.acm.org/)** in Montr√©al, Canada
