Researchers across several HCI-related communities have investigated various aspects of data visualization on mobile devices. Yet, we are far from leveraging the full potential of mobile devices in satisfying the growing demand for visual access to data on small displays. As mobile visualization becomes more common and new mobile device form factors and hardware capabilities emerge in the coming years, it is timely to reflect on what has been discovered to date and to look into the future. This workshop will bring together researchers, designers, and practitioners from relevant application and research fields, including visualization, personal informatics, and data journalism. Our goal is to define a research agenda for mobile data visualization as well as to collect and propagate practical guidance for mobile visualization designers.

**(L to R)**: *Bongshin Lee, Matthew Brehmer, Petra Isenberg, Eun Kyoung Choe, Ricardo Langner, and Raimund Dachselt*.

Our organization team is comprised of members having several relevant qualifications that will ensure a successful workshop. The core background of our team members range from visualization research (Brehmer, Isenberg, & Lee) to HCI (Choe, Dachselt, Langner, & Lee) to UbiComp (Choe). All team members have previously organized industry and academic workshops in several venues, and have extensive experience reviewing publications for international conferences, workshops, and symposia. 

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> **[Bongshin Lee](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/bongshin/)** ([@bongshin](https://twitter.com/bongshin)) is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research. She explores innovative ways to enable people to create visualizations, interact with their data, and share data-driven stories. She has been recently focusing on helping people collect & explore the data about themselves, and share insights with others by leveraging visualizations. She earned her Ph.D. in Computer Science from University of Maryland at College Park in 2006. 

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> **[Matthew Brehmer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mabrehme/)** ([@mattbrehmer](https://twitter.com/mattbrehmer)) is a Postdoctoral Researcher at Microsoft Research and a representative of the Microsoft Data Journalism Program. His research interests involve designing and evaluating information visualization techniques for storytelling and journalism, considering the perspectives of both the audience or information consumer and the author or content creator. He is the co-chair of the [2018 IEEE PacificVis Visual Data Storytelling Contest](http://itolab.is.ocha.ac.jp/pvis2018/#Storytelling_Contest) and the Visualization in Practice event at [IEEE VIS 2018](http://ieeevis.org/year/2018/info/committees/conference-committee).
He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver in 2016.

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> **[Petra Isenberg](https://petra.isenberg.cc/wiki/pmwiki.php)** ([@dr_pi](https://twitter.com/dr_pi))  is a research scientist at Inria. Prior to joining Inria, Petra received her PhD from the University of Calgary in 2009. Her main research areas are information visualization and visual analytics with a focus on collaborative work scenarios, interaction, and evaluation. She is interested in exploring how people can most effectively analyze data sets on novel display technology such as small touch-screens, wall displays, or tabletops. 

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> **[Eun Kyoung Choe](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~choe/)** ([@slowalpaca](https://twitter.com/slowalpaca)) is an Assistant Professor in the College of Information Studies at University of Maryland, College Park. She has been examining ways to help people become empowered individuals through fully leveraging their personal data. She has been exploring this topic in various contexts including the Quantified Self movement, sleep, patient-clinician communication, and personal data insights & visualization. She received her Ph.D. in Information Science from University of Washington in 2014.

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> **[Ricardo Langner](https://imld.de/our-group/team/ricardo-langner/)** ([@riclangner](https://twitter.com/riclangner)) is a Ph.D. student at the Technische Universität Dresden. His research focuses on the combination of multiple displays, such as mobile devices, interactive tabletops, and large shared displays, for information visualization. In particular, he explores new and innovative ways of using mobile devices to support data exploration with multiple coordinated visualization views. He was also a local arrangements co-chair of ACM ITS 2014.

<i class="fa fa-user" aria-hidden="true"></i> **[Raimund Dachselt](https://imld.de/our-group/team/raimund-dachselt/)** ([@RaimundDachselt](https://twitter.com/RaimundDachselt)) is a full university professor for Computer Science at Technische Universität Dresden and a director of the Interactive Media Lab Dresden. His research focuses on Natural User Interface (NUI) approaches with various input modalities on interactive surfaces and in multi-display environments. His team contributed several solutions applying NUI techniques to the field of Information Visualization and Immersive Analytics. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from TU Dresden in 2004.
